CHERI is a hardware approach to memory safety that improves system security at runtime by extending established ISAs, such as ARM, RISC-V, and x86, with new architectural features. This cross-architecture project adapts the Linux Kernel and userspace software to benefit from CHERI's memory protection and software compartmentalization features.
