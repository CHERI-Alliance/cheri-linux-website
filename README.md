This repository contains the static website for [cheri-linux.org](https://cheri-linux.org)

## Building the website

This website is for use with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website framework.

To test it, run a local website and see your changes live by running
```
hugo server -w -D
```

To build the website, run
```
hugo
```

The static website files will then be in the `public` directory.
