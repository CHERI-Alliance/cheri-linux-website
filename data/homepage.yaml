    - text: Extensive research and development activity has gone into porting a version of FreeBSD, called <a href="https://www.cheribsd.org/">CheriBSD</a>, to use CHERI’s features, and in particular explore and evaluate the sizeable design space of potential CHERI integrations with a general-purpose, MMU-based operating system. This work has been highly successful, with memory-safe ports of the FreeBSD kernel and userlevel, and over 10,000 open source packages using a CHERI-adapted LLVM toolchain. With a clear set of abstractions defined, and existing prototypes evaluated at scale, efforts to port Linux will be substantially less work.
    - text: Our strategy is to maximize portability of CHERI protection, language integration, and APIs across architectures (e.g., Arm’s Morello, CHERI-RISC-V), tools (e.g., LLVM, QEMU, Yocto), and operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD, Linux). This minimizes developer burden in adapting application-level code, ensures that lessons learned in any of these can be broadly benefited from in all, and helps reinforce the message to upstream communities that CHERI protection is a well defined, portable, and consistently implemented model, and sufficiently mature to adopt.
